 * drand timelock encryption (a.k.a. tlock).

 * 52db9ba70...4e971, 3-second rounds, BLS12-381). That's the network we
 * use everywhere in Hermetic.
 *
 * Output of `timelockEncrypt` is an age-armored string. We pass it around
 * as text, including when storing on IPFS (encoded to UTF-8 bytes).
 *
 * Buffer is from the npm `buffer` package (polyfilled by webpack/Next in
 * the browser) so this module works in both Node and the browser.
